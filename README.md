### Turkish international trade analysis
<p>
    The analysis aims to provide a general overview of the state of TÃ¼rkiye's international trade. I've decided to rely on Python as a main tool. Thus, the entire      analysis is inside this notebook. The entire raw data was split into 2 datasets: export and import. Values are presented in US$1000 units.

<p>
    Analysis is located in the <i><b>TR trade 2022_03.ipynb</b></i> file. Data are in <i><b>export_by_countries_2023_03</b></i> and <i><b>import_by_countries_2023_03</b></i> files.
