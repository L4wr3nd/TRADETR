### Turkish international trade analysis
<p>
The analysis aims to provide a general overview of the state of TÃ¼rkiye's international trade. The project includes 2 analysis files: Excel and Python (jupyter notebook). Both have partly different approach to the analysis but they still include some similar/same content. The entire original, raw data was split into 2 datasets: export and import. Values are presented in US$1000 units.
