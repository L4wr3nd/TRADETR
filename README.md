Turkish international trade analysis
The analysis aims to provide a general overview of the state of TÃ¼rkiye's international trade. I've decided to rely on Python as a main tool. Thus, the entire analysis is inside this notebook. The entire data is split into 2 datasets: export and import. Values are presented in US$1000 units.

Table of contents:
- Data general overview, cleaning/preparation;
- Annual data analysis;
- Last year analysis by countries.
